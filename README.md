# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
In this project, I have picked a data set from amazon reviews regarding cell phone accessories and used Pyspark to perform the ETL process by extracting the data, transforming the data, and connecting it to the database generated through the AWS webserver. With the reviews, my goal is to determine if there is favorable review bias from the Vine members of our data set.
## Results:
## How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
In the data set their was a total of 30765 5-star reviews
30543 of the 5-star reviews were non-vine
## What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
47.5% of the five_star reviews were vine
45.7% of the five_star reviews were none_vine
## Summary:
After I had come up with my analysis, there is little positivity bias because the percentages shown above are very similar at 45%. Therefore, the vine program does not produce significant bias in concluding the analysis.
